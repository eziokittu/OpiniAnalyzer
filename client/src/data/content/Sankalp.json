          "Ease of Use: Lexicon-based approaches like VADER are relatively easy to implement and use compared to more complex machine learning models. They typically require less computational resources and training data.",
          "Fast Processing: Lexicon-based approaches are often faster than machine learning models since they do not require training time. They can process text data quickly, making them suitable for real-time applications such as social media monitoring.",
          "Interpretability: Lexicon-based approaches provide transparency and interpretability. Since sentiment scores are based on predefined word lists or dictionaries, it's easier to understand how sentiment is calculated for each piece of text.",
          "Domain Adaptability: Lexicon-based approaches can be adapted to different domains or languages by updating the sentiment lexicon or dictionary. This flexibility allows users to customize sentiment analysis for specific contexts or industries.",
          "Robustness: Lexicon-based approaches are often robust to noisy or informal text data, such as social media posts or product reviews, where grammar and language conventions may vary."
        ]
      ],
      ["Cons", 
        [
          "Limited Context Awareness: Lexicon-based approaches may struggle with understanding context-dependent sentiment. They often assign sentiment scores based solely on individual words without considering the surrounding context, leading to potential inaccuracies.",
          "Difficulty with Sarcasm and Irony: Lexicon-based approaches may misinterpret sarcastic or ironic expressions since they rely on the sentiment polarity of individual words. Sarcasm and irony can change the overall sentiment of a sentence, making it challenging for lexicon-based tools to accurately capture.",
          "Limited Sentiment Nuances: Lexicon-based approaches may oversimplify sentiment analysis by reducing sentiment to positive, negative, or neutral categories. They may struggle to capture nuanced sentiment expressions or subtle variations in sentiment intensity.",
          "Dependency on Lexicons: The effectiveness of lexicon-based approaches heavily depends on the quality and coverage of the sentiment lexicon or dictionary used. Lexicons may contain inaccuracies, biases, or gaps, leading to errors in sentiment analysis results.",
          "Limited Generalization: Lexicon-based approaches may not generalize well to new or unseen data, especially in domains or languages where the sentiment lexicon is not well-established or comprehensive. They may perform poorly on texts with vocabulary or linguistic structures not covered by the lexicon."
