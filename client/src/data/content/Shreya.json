      ["What is NLP?", "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field in artificial intelligence focusing on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. Deep learning has greatly contributed to NLP by enabling models to learn intricate language features and perform tasks such as translation, sentiment analysis as well as text generation with high precision."],
      ["What is Deep NLP?", "Deep NLP (DNLP) combines deep learning methods with NLP techniques to construct sophisticated models that can understand, generate, manipulate human language. Frequently, DNLP models employ architectures such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or transformer models for efficient sequential data processing and capturing contextual information effectively."],

By considering both the left and right sides of words in any sentence it is put through; it has been found to be effective at understanding the context of words. BERT has improved several NLP tasks such as text classification, question answering and named entity recognition greatly by pre-training on large text datasets and fine-tuning on specific tasks."],
