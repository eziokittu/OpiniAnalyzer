    ["Text Preprocessing", "Before analyzing sentiment, text data needs preprocessing to clean it. Common steps include removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and handling special characters."],
    ["Feature Extraction", "Convert text into numerical or categorical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms. Common techniques include bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe."],
    ["Model Selection", "Choose an appropriate model for sentiment analysis. Popular choices include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)."],
    ["Training", "Train the selected model using labeled data. Labeled data consists of text examples paired with their corresponding sentiment labels (e.g., positive, negative, neutral)."],
    ["Testing and Evaluation", "Evaluate the trained model using a separate set of labeled data not seen during training. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score."],
    ["Inference", "Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict sentiment on unseen text data."],
    ["Post-processing", "Optionally, apply post-processing techniques to refine sentiment predictions. For example, you might use rules or heuristics to adjust predictions based on context or domain-specific knowledge."],
    ["Deployment", "Deploy the trained model into production systems where it can analyze sentiment in real-time or batch processing pipelines."],
    ["Feedback Loop (Optional)", "Continuously improve the model's performance by collecting feedback from users or monitoring its predictions in production. This feedback can be used to retrain the model on updated data or to fine-tune its parameters."],
    ["Conclusion", "By following these steps, sentiment analysis systems can effectively analyze the sentiment expressed in text data without relying on the NLTK library."]
